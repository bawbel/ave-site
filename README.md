## What this repo is

This repo contains the website only — HTML, CSS, JS, and assets for `ave.bawbel.io`. It is a **consumer** of the AVE standard, not part of the standard itself.

The records, schema, detection rules, and fixtures live in **[bawbel/ave](https://github.com/bawbel/ave)**. Pushing new AVE records to that repo automatically triggers a rebuild and deployment of this site via GitHub Actions `repository_dispatch`.

AVE relates to frameworks like OWASP AST10 the way CVE relates to OWASP Top 10 — a Top 10 names the categories that matter; AVE supplies the individually-scored, individually-detectable records underneath them. See [Crosswalks](#crosswalks) below for how this plays out on the site.

## Pages

| Page | URL | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Landing | `/` | Overview, stats, links to all sections |
| Registry | `/registry.html` | Searchable, filterable table of all AVE records with full detail drawer |
| Crosswalks | `/crosswalks.html` | How SkillSpector, ClawScan, OWASP AST10, OWASP MCP, and MITRE ATLAS map to AVE ids |
| Architecture | `/architecture.html` | How an AVE record works — for tool implementers |
| Schema | `/schema.html` | Every field, type, required/optional, meaning — schema v1.0.0 reference |

---

## Crosswalks

The crosswalks page has two genuinely different data sources, and they do **not** scale the same way when records are added. This trips people up — read this before editing anything in `crosswalks/`.

### Fully dynamic — the AVE → OWASP · MITRE ATLAS table

This table is inline in `crosswalks.html` and reads `window.RECORDS` from `records.js` directly. It loops over every record and renders one row per record, using the `owasp_mcp`, `owasp_mapping`, and `mitre_atlas_mapping` fields already present on each record. **When you rebuild `records.js` with more records, this table grows automatically. No content changes needed, ever.**

### Dynamic rendering, static content — the SkillSpector / ClawScan / AST10 tables

These three tables live in `crosswalks/*.json`, loaded via `crosswalks/manifest.json`. The **rendering** is dynamic — drop a new crosswalk JSON file into the folder, add one line to `manifest.json`, and it appears on the page with no HTML changes. But the **mapping content inside each file is hand-authored**, not derived from `records.js`. There is no code that infers "AVE-2026-00049 belongs in the `header-tamper` ClawScan category" — that judgment call has to be made once by a person (or by an LLM working from the record's `attack_class` and `behavioral_fingerprint`) and written into the JSON.

**Practical implication:** when new AVE records are added to `bawbel/ave` (e.g. the v1.1 migration's 3 new records), the bottom OWASP/MITRE table picks them up automatically on the next site rebuild. The three external crosswalks will not mention them until someone manually adds entries to the relevant `crosswalks/*.json` files. This is a one-time task per new record, not a recurring burden — existing records already have their crosswalk entries.

```
crosswalks/
├── manifest.json              lists which JSON files to load, in order
├── skillspector-to-ave.json   NVIDIA SkillSpector, 16 categories
├── clawscan-to-ave.json       ClawScan, 7 modules / 19 rules
└── ave-to-ast10.json          OWASP AST10, 10 risk categories with severity
```

Add a new crosswalk: drop the JSON file here, add one line to `manifest.json`'s `files` array. The page auto-detects the shape (`category`+`ave_ids` vs `ast_id`+`ast_title`+`ast_severity`+`ave_ids`) and renders the right template — no HTML edits required.

---

## Important notes

### Record shape compatibility

AVE records at `schema_version: 0.2.0` store severity at `aivss.aivss_severity`
rather than the top-level `severity` field required by schema v1.0.0. The registry
and crosswalks pages include a runtime normaliser that backfills missing fields
automatically. This is resolved permanently when records are migrated to schema
v1.0.0 in v1.1.

### Schema validation flag

Until all 48 records are migrated to v1.0.0, run the build with `--skip-validation`:

```bash
npm run build:skip-validation
```

Remove this flag after the v1.1 migration is complete. The validator is intentionally
strict — if it rejects a record, the record needs to be fixed, not the schema.

---

## Local development

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+, and `bawbel/ave` checked out as a sibling directory.

```
parent/
├── ave/          ← github.com/bawbel/ave
└── ave-site/     ← github.com/bawbel/ave-site  (this repo)
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bawbel/ave
git clone https://github.com/bawbel/ave-site
cd ave-site

npm install
npm run build:local   # reads ../ave/records → writes records.js

# serve locally — fetch() requires real HTTP, file:// will not work
# for crosswalks.html or any page that loads records.js via fetch
npx serve .
# or
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Build commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run build:local` | Build from `../ave/records` (local dev, validates against schema) |
| `npm run build:skip-validation` | Build without schema validation (use until v1.1 migration) |
| `npm run build` | Build from default path (CI) |
| `npm run build:drafts` | Include `status: "draft"` records |
| `npm run build:dry` | Validate records without writing `records.js` |

### Custom path

```bash
node scripts/build-records.js \
  --records-dir ../ave/records \
  --schema      ../ave/schema/ave-record-1.0.0.schema.json \
  --out         records.js \
  --skip-validation   # remove after v1.1 migration
```

---

## How the build works

`scripts/build-records.js` reads every `AVE-YYYY-NNNNN.json` from the records
directory, validates against the schema (skippable via `--skip-validation`),
excludes drafts, sorts CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW then by id, and writes
`records.js` — the static JS module the site loads at runtime.

`records.js` is **gitignored**. It is generated fresh on every CI build from
the canonical source in `bawbel/ave`. Never edit it by hand.

This script only touches `records.js`. It does not touch `crosswalks/*.json` —
see [Crosswalks](#crosswalks) above for why that's a separate, manual step.

---

## Deployment

Deploys to [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` in this repo
- `repository_dispatch` (`ave-records-updated`) from `bawbel/ave` when records, schema, or rules change
- Manual trigger from the Actions tab

**To wire up the cross-repo trigger:**

1. Create a fine-grained PAT — repository `bawbel/ave-site`, permissions: Contents (read) + Actions (write)
2. Add it as `AVE_SITE_DEPLOY_TOKEN` in `bawbel/ave` → Settings → Secrets
3. Copy `notify-ave-site.yml` into `bawbel/ave/.github/workflows/`

After that, pushing a new AVE record to `bawbel/ave` automatically rebuilds and
deploys the site within a few minutes. Remember: this updates `records.js` (and
therefore the bottom OWASP/MITRE table) automatically — it does **not** update
the three external crosswalks. See [Crosswalks](#crosswalks).

**Custom domain:** Set `ave.bawbel.io` as the custom domain in GitHub Pages settings.
Add a CNAME record in Namecheap pointing `ave` → `bawbel.github.io`.

## Contributing

This repo is for the website. To propose a new AVE record or a schema change, open an issue in **[bawbel/ave](https://github.com/bawbel/ave)**.

To fix a bug or improve the site (UI, crosswalk tables, content), open a PR here. Keep the site a consumer of the standard — no AVE record data lives here except what `build-records.js` generates and what's hand-authored in `crosswalks/*.json`.

Adding a new external-tool crosswalk (e.g. a fourth scanner): create the JSON file in `crosswalks/` following the shape of the existing files, add one line to `crosswalks/manifest.json`, open a PR. No HTML changes needed.
